This is a responsive pricing table design which was created during a web development bootcamp course on Udemy. This design showcases my skills in front-end development and my ability to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. The pricing table is responsive, meaning it adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and optimal user experience across devices.
